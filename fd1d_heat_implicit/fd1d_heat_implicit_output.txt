FD1D_HEAT_IMPLICIT
  C++ version

  Finite difference solution of\n  the time dependent 1D heat equation

    Ut - k * Uxx = F(x,t)

  for space interval A <= X <= B with boundary conditions

    U(A,t) = UA(t)
    U(B,t) = UB(t)

  and time interval T0 <= T <= T1 with initial condition

    U(X,T0) = U0(X).

  A second order difference approximation is used for Uxx.

  A first order backward Euler difference approximation
  is used for Ut.

  X data written to "x.txt".
  T data written to "t.txt".
  U data written to "u.txt".
