PARTIAL_DIGEST_TEST:
  C++ version
  Test the PARTIAL_DIGEST library.

FIND_DISTANCES_TEST:
  FIND_DISTANCES takes a candidate location Y
  and determines whether its distance to each point
  in the X array is listed in the L array.

  Initial L array:

         0:       13
         1:       15
         2:       38
         3:       90
         4:        2
         5:       25
         6:       77
         7:       23
         8:       75
         9:       52

  Consider Y = 77

  This Y is acceptable.

  New X array:

         0:        0
         1:       90
         2:       77

  New L array:

         0:       52
         1:       15
         2:        2
         3:       25
         4:       38
         5:       23
         6:       75

  Consider Y = 35

  This Y is not acceptable.

        15       139
        16      -100
        17       170
        18         5
        19       -72
        20       -96

I4VEC_MAX_LAST_TEST
  I4VEC_MAX_LAST identifies the largest element in an
  I4VEC, and moves it to the final entry.

  Input vector:

         0:        7
         1:       29
         2:       25
         3:       17
         4:       13
         5:        2
         6:        8
         7:        4
         8:        2
         9:       20

  Maximum: = 29

  Output vector:

         0:        7
         1:       25
         2:       17
         3:       13
         4:        2
         5:        8
         6:        4
         7:        2
         8:       20
         9:       29

I4VEC_PRINT_TEST
  I4VEC_PRINT prints an I4VEC

  Here is the I4VEC:

         0:       91
         1:       92
         2:       93
         3:       94

PARTIAL_DIGEST_RECUR_TEST01
  PARTIAL_DIGEST_RECUR generates solutions to the partial
  digest problem, using recursion

  The number of objects to place is N = 5

  The original placement was 0,3,6,8,10.
  These placements generate the following distances:

  Distance array:

         0:        2
         1:        2
         2:        3
         3:        3
         4:        4
         5:        5
         6:        6
         7:        7
         8:        8
         9:       10

  PARTIAL_DIGEST_RECUR may recover the original placements
  from the pairwise distances.  It may also find other
  placements that have the same distance array.

  Solution:

         0:        0
         1:       10
         2:        8
         3:        3
         4:        6

  Solution:

         0:        0
         1:       10
         2:        2
         3:        7
         4:        4

PARTIAL_DIGEST_TEST:
  Normal end of execution.
